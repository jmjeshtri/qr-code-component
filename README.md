## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```html
<main>
    <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR-Code">
    <div id="text">
      <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
      <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
    </div>
  </main>
```
**Note: Don't put everything into divs, keep it as simple as you can**

```css
* {
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
**Resseting all margins and paddings**

### Continued development

#### Goals 

Keep working on other projects
